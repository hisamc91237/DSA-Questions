Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

APPROACH 1: Brute Force

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        ListNode* temp ;
        
        while(headA != NULL){
            temp = headB;
            while(temp!=NULL){
                if(headA == temp) return headA;
                
                temp = temp->next;
            }
            headA = headA->next;
        }
        return NULL;
    }
};

Time Complexity : O(m * n)
Space Complexity : O(1)


APPROACH 2 : Hashmap

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        unordered_map<ListNode* , int>m;
        
        while(headA!=NULL){
            m[headA]++;
            headA = headA -> next;
        }
        while(headB!=NULL){
            if(m[headB] > 0) return headB;
            headB = headB->next;
        }
        return NULL;
    }
};

Time Complexity : O(m + n)
Space Complexity : O(m)



APPROACH 3: Optimized

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        ListNode* a = headA;
        ListNode* b = headB;
        
        while(a!=b){
            
            // start traversing a again from head of b if it reaches NULL.
            if(a == NULL) a = headB;
            else a = a->next;
            
            // start traversing b again from head of a if it reaches NULL.
            if(b == NULL) b = headA;
            else b = b->next;
            
        }
        return a;
    }
};
