1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

APPROACH:

class Solution {
    public int getDecimalValue(ListNode head) {
        
        ListNode temp = head;
        int ans = 0;
        
        while(temp!=null){
            ans *= 2;
            ans += temp.val;
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
