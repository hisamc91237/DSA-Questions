Consider an array with N elements and value of all the elements is zero. We can perform following operations on the array.
         1. Incremental operations: Choose 1 element from the array and increment its value by 1.
         2. Doubling operation: Double the values of all the elements of array.
Given an array arr[] of integers of size N. Print the smallest possible number of operations needed to change the original array containing only zeroes to arr[]

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {16, 16, 16}
Output: 7
Explanation: First apply an incremental 
operation to each element. Then apply the 
doubling operation four times. 
Total number of operations is 3+4 = 7.

APPROACH :

class Solution{   
public:
    int countMinOperations(int arr[], int n) {
              sort(arr , arr + n);
              int ans=0;
            while(true){
            for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
                if (arr[i]%2==1){
                arr[i]--;ans++;
                }
                arr[i]=arr[i]/2;
            }
          if(arr[n-1]==0)break;
          ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
