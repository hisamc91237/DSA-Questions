Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

APPROACH : 

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
            
        unordered_map<string , vector<string>>mp;  
        
        vector<vector<string>> ans;
        
        // iterate entire string.
        for(auto x : strs){
            
            // store before sorting.
            string temp = x;
            
            // sort the current element.. i.e "eat" as it is vector of strings.
            sort(x.begin() , x.end());
            
            // push curr and before element in map.
            mp[x].push_back(temp);
        }
        
        for(auto x : mp){
            ans.push_back(x.second);
        }
        
        return ans;
        
    }
};
