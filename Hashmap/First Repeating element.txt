Given an array arr[] of size n, find the first repeating element. The element should occurs more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.

Input:
n = 7
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
5 is appearing twice and 
its first appearence is at index 2 
which is less than 3 whose first 
occuring index is 3.

APPROACH : 

 public:
    // Function to return the position of the first repeating element.
    int firstRepeated(int arr[], int n) {
        int ans = -1;
        
        unordered_map <int , int> mp;
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++) mp[arr[i]]++;
        
        for(int i=0 ; i<n;i++){
            if(mp[arr[i]] > 1){
                ans = i + 1;
                return ans;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
